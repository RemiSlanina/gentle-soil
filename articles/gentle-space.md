# Gentle Space

_A search for the smaller shell_

Micro-living is more than a trend — it’s a necessity for many people, and a chance for gentler, more sustainable homes. Yet these spaces remain rare. What would it mean if we built more small, accessible, eco-friendly homes for those who want or need them?

## Why is micro-living so rare?

This world was built for consumption. Growth is still too often measured in square meters — not in your footprint, not in your well-being.

Consumption is everything.  
Or so we’ve been told.

Many people dream of micro-living, and yet rarely live in spaces under 50 m². Why? There are many reasons. But one truth remains:

**Micro-living is exquisitely rare.**  
If you’re looking for spaces under 20 m² that are quiet, eco-gentle, affordable, and non-toxic — tell me if you find one, because I’d be interested too. As of today, such spaces are almost unavailable in most central European countries, despite clear demand.

### Why so few exist

- **Zoning laws and regulations**
- **Market-driven assumptions**
- **Cultural norms**
- **Accessibility misunderstandings**

## Why people seek out micro-living

- For economic reasons (cheaper heating and electricity)
- For health reasons (chronic illness, elderly needs, recovery)
- For environmental reasons 🌍
- Minimalist worldviews
- For disability reasons (autism, sensory overwhelm, executive dysfunction)
- Poverty, migration, or energy limitations — queer, trans, neurodivergent, and other marginalized communities
- Because smaller spaces are easier to organize, maintain, and live in with less stress

And yet, the narrative often remains the same:  
**“The bigger, the better.”**

## Barriers to micro-flats and tiny homes

### Zoning laws and regulations

Some cities still enforce minimum requirements on size and comfort. These often stem from outdated health standards or market-based assumptions — not from people’s lived needs.

### Market-driven assumptions

Developers rarely build what’s most eco-friendly. They build what’s most profitable. In today’s economy, that means marketing to families, dual-income couples, or anyone expected to want larger living spaces. That may serve some — but it doesn’t reflect all of us.

### Cultural norms

The “ideal home” still includes:  
a room for each child, a large bathroom, a spacious kitchen, a living room with a big sofa.

Tiny spaces, by contrast, are often considered less desirable — even stigmatized.

### Accessibility misunderstandings

Accessibility is not just about wheelchair use. People in wheelchairs must always be supported — every home and public space should be accessible to them.

But here’s the problem: accessibility is too often reduced _only_ to wheelchair access. Disabled people with diverse needs are overlooked. Many of us depend on smaller, easier-to-manage spaces to live autonomously.

It’s ironic — and painful — that the very spaces that would increase accessibility for us would also be better for the environment and cheaper to maintain.

Supporting wheelchair accessibility is non-negotiable. But when those needs are used to erase others, that too becomes ableism.

## A vision

I’ll borrow here from an AI-generated vision — because I couldn’t have said it more beautifully:

> _A village of tiny, toxin-free homes, spread out like stars on soft land.  
> Each home custom-sized.  
> Some 15 m². Some 30.  
> Built of breathable materials.  
> Herb gardens between them.  
> No cars — just footpaths and bikes.  
> A shared workshop, maybe.  
> Maybe even a shared tea room — but only if you want to go._
>
> _No forced conversations.  
> No artificial scents.  
> Just space to be._
>
> _Maybe we build it in dreams first.  
> Then with sketches.  
> Then with others._

## My own small step

Soon, I’ll be moving into a micro-flat. It’s not truly “micro” — just under 30 m² — but it’s a start. And like so many micro-units, it’s borrowed, short-term. You’re not expected to stay. Sometimes, you’re not even _allowed_ to rent long-term.

Many of these flats are “all-in” arrangements with furniture or added luxury, making them ironically less accessible to low-income people or those with pets. They often cost more in the long run than managing things yourself.

Still, there are some options:

- Micro-flats
- Tiny houses
- Shared living

## The practical benefits

Even a space of 16–19 m² can mean:
