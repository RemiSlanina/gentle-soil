# Restoring What Was Lost

### or: How the Wild Cat Almost Vanished

---

🐾

## Introduction

Heat dries the soil. Thin, sand-like particles rise — and the wind carries them away. What sounds like poetry is in fact reality across much of Europe’s farmland today.

Environmental destruction surrounds us. Europe’s wildlife — from wolves to woodpeckers — has retreated. Some species, like the elusive wild cat, are close to disappearing altogether. Forests are now few and scattered, and almost none are primary temperate forests anymore.

Temperate native forests are special. They aren’t tree plantations, where firs and pines are farmed in monocultures and harvested for timber. They aren’t tropical rainforests either. They are old, diverse ecosystems — once vast, now nearly lost — that evolved in Europe’s moderate climate.

Reforesting temperate native forests will not stop climate change on its own. But it can slow it. It can give our descendants time. And it might give the wild cat a way back.

## 1. Not All Forests Are Tropical

Global debates about forests often focus on the tropics. And rightly so: the Amazon and other rainforests are lush, fast-growing, and vital. Yet Europe’s temperate forests once covered vast stretches of land. Today, almost all are gone.

Even non-native, managed forests have become scarce. But temperate native forests can do what monocultures cannot:

- Store carbon deep in wood and soils, often for centuries
- Conserve water and resist droughts and fires
- Support rich biodiversity — from lichens and fungi to wolves and owls

Reforesting Europe isn’t about replacing tropical efforts — it’s about complementing them, and taking responsibility close to home. The results won’t come quickly. But over decades, temperate forests can even surpass tropical ones in total carbon storage.

> Once, the wild cat roamed these forests. Today, she hides. You may never see her — she’s as shy as she is beautiful — but she still exists. Barely.

## 2. What the Wild Cat Needs

The European wildcat (_Felis silvestris silvestris_) is a quiet survivor. She looks almost like a tabby housecat — but she’s stronger, broader, and fiercely independent. Unlike her domestic cousins, she avoids humans whenever possible.

Her needs are simple: space, shelter, and connection.

But Europe’s forests have been cut, fenced, and fragmented. Small woodland patches are not enough for hunting, breeding, or safety. Many wildcat populations are now genetically isolated — trapped by farmland, highways, and suburbs.

She doesn’t just need trees. She needs forests that connect.

> A hedge between fields might seem trivial. For a wild cat, it’s a lifeline — cover from predators, a path to a mate, a way to cross a hostile landscape.

## 3. How Forest Restoration Works

Forest restoration is more than planting trees. It’s about healing ecosystems from the ground up, until they can thrive on their own again.

Key steps include:

- **Site selection**: abandoned farmland, degraded woods, eroded slopes
- **Passive restoration**: fencing out livestock, letting seeds return naturally
- **Active restoration**: planting native saplings from local seed sources
- **Mixed-species stands**: oak (_Quercus robur_), beech (_Fagus sylvatica_), Scots pine (_Pinus sylvestris_), birch (_Betula_), and others
- **Maintenance**: critical in the first 3–5 years — fencing, weeding, watering
- **Long-term care**: minimal interference once canopy closes; let deadwood and natural gaps form

> And in time, when rodents return and trees thicken — she returns, too. Not overnight, but quietly. One paw, one step at a time.

## 4. What We’ve Lost in the Fields

Temperate forests aren’t the only things vanishing. Hedgerows and field margins — once common in Europe’s farmland — are disappearing too.

Their loss has consequences:

- Birds and insects lose shelter
- Water runs off instead of soaking in
- Wind strips away topsoil — the thin, fertile skin that feeds us all

For wild cats and other animals, these open fields are dangerous: too exposed to cross, too barren to survive.

> To restore forests is also to restore fields — to bring back edges, shadows, and transitions. To reconnect the fragments we still have while planting new ones for the future.

## 5. What You Can Do

You don’t need to be a landowner — or even able-bodied — to make a difference.

- Join or support small forest associations
- Help with grant writing, websites, or educational materials
- Support citizen science: camera traps, bird counts, seed banks
- Fund fencing as well as seedlings — survival needs protection
- Advocate for hedgerow recovery in your municipality

> Maybe you can’t plant a forest. But maybe you can plant an idea, or hold it steady while others act.

## 6. A Short Note on “Sponsor a Tree” Projects

Not all tree planting is restoration.

Some certificate schemes promise offsets but plant **fast-growing monocultures** (like eucalyptus or pine) in poor soils. These projects often:

- Lack biodiversity
- Deplete groundwater
- Operate on short harvest cycles that release stored carbon
- Provide little to no benefit for wildlife

It’s true that even plantations can sometimes reduce pressure on natural forests. But for lasting climate and biodiversity benefits, support projects that focus on:

- Native species
- Mixed plantings
- Long-term stewardship
- Transparency (maps, survival rates, open data)
- Local community involvement

> Restoration isn’t a transaction. It’s a relationship — and a long one.

## 7. A Visitor from the Past

The vision of regenerating temperate forests and hedgerows offers many benefits:

- Corridors of woodland threading across valleys
- Hedges bounding fields again, protecting wildlife and soil
- Forest fragments expanding outward into primary woods again
- Healthier soil that needs less fertilizer
- Stabilized water cycles
- And, perhaps, the wild cat stepping forward again — unseen, but no longer undone

This is not fantasy. It’s within reach. But it needs action, patience, and care.

## Conclusion

Restoring Europe’s temperate forests will not “solve” climate change. Neither will public transport or cycling to work. But each is a step we can take — for nature, for soil, for wild cats.

Every hedge, every thicket, every mossy log is a small stepping stone for a little furry being: leaving a pawprint pressed there: quiet, unseen... still waiting for help.

What has been taken is enormous. But the question remains:

> What do we want to give back?

And: will our descendants know the wild cat — or will she vanish forever, this time for good?
